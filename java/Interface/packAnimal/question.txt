Exercise 3:     

The Transport interface declares a deliver method. 
The abstract class Animal is the superclass of the Tiger, Camel, Deer and Donkey classes. 
The Transport interface is implemented by the Camel and Donkey classes. 
Write a Java program to initialize an array of four Animal objects. 
If the object implements the Transport interface, the deliver method is invoked. 
Use suitable data members.
